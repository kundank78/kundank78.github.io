Fueled by my midnight coffee & desperate need to stop procrastinating. 
Finally starting my tech blog - spent a good solid 30 minutes finding a good blogging site and copying its vibe.

#### So, here is my `Hello World!!` moment 

I am Kundan Kumar, a software engineer since 2020. JAVA is my coding jam for work. 
Lately, obsessed with Distributed Systems & Database Internals and also trying to convince myself Golang is my best friend.
My blog might not be the best ones you will find in the chaotic internet sea, but I will try to give some good tech tidbits 
& inspire you a bit. 
My goal is to learn, share & maybe, just maybe, make this blog worth your time. Wish me luck!.
